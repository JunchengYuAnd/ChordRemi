Project Overview


The idea and goals of the project:

This project explores controllable symbolic music generation using a Transformer-based architecture.
Our goal is to generate expressive piano solos that follow user-specified chord progressions, enabling interactive and harmonically guided music creation.


A brief description of the data you used:

We collected a dataset of pop piano performances and converted them into event-based sequences using the REMI tokenization method.
To support chord control, we extended REMI by inserting two chord tokens per bar — representing the harmony in the first and second halves — which we call ChordREMI.
